# pokemon-type-checker
Website for checking type weaknesses and strenghts of a given pokemon team.  
Currently heavily WIP, hopefully finished in time for champions.

## TODO
- [ ] Fix table scaling on small viewport (low prio)
- [X] Finish pokemon sv json
- [X] Change json parsing to store data in local storage
- [ ] Implement the actual type chart

#### small disclaimer
at the time of creating this website I am a student that has not done any web development, as such i am learning as i do things, so some stuff might not be the most optimal or might not work too well
